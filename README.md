The provided code is a complete implementation of a Matatu game in C#. The main logic resides in the `Program` class, which handles the game flow, player interactions, and checks for game-ending conditions. The `Logic` class contains methods to handle game rules, computer player strategies, and scoring. The `Player` class manages the player's hand of cards and interactions with the deck.

### Key Components

1. **Game Initialization:**
   - The game starts with a welcome message and prompts the user to start or exit.
   - A deck of cards is created and shuffled.
   - Players (human and computer) draw their initial cards.

2. **Game Loop:**
   - The game continues until either player or computer has no cards left or the game is manually stopped.
   - Players take turns playing cards, drawing cards, or ending the game.
   - The computer follows specific strategies to play its cards.

3. **Card Play Logic:**
   - Players can play a card if it matches the suit or value of the top card on the discard pile.
   - Special cards (e.g., Ace, Jack, Eight) have specific rules, such as changing the current suit or skipping turns.
   - The computer evaluates its hand to choose the best move based on the current game state.

4. **Game End and Scoring:**
   - The game ends when a player has no cards left or a seven is played.
   - Scores are calculated based on the cards remaining in each player's hand.
   - The results are displayed, indicating the winner or if the game is a tie.

### Improvements and Considerations

1. **Code Readability:**
   - Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., method names should be camelCase).
   - Add comments to explain complex logic, especially in the `Logic` class.

2. **Modularity:**
   - Separate the game logic from the user interface for better maintainability.
   - Consider creating separate classes for different card types and their behaviors.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Add input validation to handle invalid inputs from the user.
   - Ensure that the game gracefully handles unexpected errors or edge cases.

4. **Enhancements:**
   - Implement a more sophisticated AI for the computer player.
   - Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for a better user experience.
   - Include additional game features or variations.
